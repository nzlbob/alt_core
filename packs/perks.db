When a player wants to determine what his hero remembers, or if he wants his hero to remember a specific detail (such as a license plate number or details of a document he glanced at), then a perk check is made. An Ordinary success is usually enough to provide some of the details the hero wants, The Gamemaster sets the situation die according to the type of detail and memory the hero is trying to recall.</p>\n<p>For example, an attempt to re- member something the hero knows extremely well might receive a -3 bonus or might not even require a check at all, while recalling the image of a face glimpsed briefly in the dark might receive a +3 penalty.</p>","unidentified":""},"source":"","pubnsource":"","type":"","availability":"","modifiers":[],"abilityMod":{"ability":"","mod":1},"skill":"","acb":null,"xpcost":3,"damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"JiMh6DXB6lBc2584":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.5P7Z7edX9Kn4BxCX"}}}
