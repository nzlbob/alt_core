On closer inspection, however, the similarities are quickly outdistanced by the differences, Veins of circuitry weave with flesh and blood to form a tolally synthesized body. The me civ alus's hair is a combination of pro- tein strands and filaments of cable and wire.

A large group of explorers trav- eled in three si aw- moving colony ships, crossing The void of space over Ihe course of many centuries. The trip was plagued by one disaster after another, though, so that by the time these colony ships reached the Sol system, contact with the fraal horn &copy;world had been lost. In addi- tion, damage to the ship's computers resulted in the loss of much vital in- formation, including some techno- logical know-how and most histori- cal and scholarly records &mdash; among these the location of the Jraal home- world. The starfarers were cut off, isolated from their place of origin, and unaware of their original mis- sion. Indeed, they weren't even sure ii Earth was the destination they had been traveling to reach, or for what purpose. Thanks to eons of lost knowledge and countless mechani- cal breakdowns, accidents, and trav- el-related mishaps, these fraal were truly alone.<br>Initially; the traal set up installa- tions on Earth, building bases in iso- lated regions using local materials and components salvaged from their colony ships. From these hidden bases, the visitors set out to explore the planet and meet its inhabitants.</p>\n<p>Humans, still primitive but demon- strating great potential, were begin- ning to spread out from the geo- graphic cradles that spawned them by the time the fraal arrived. Meet- ings between the two species led to the birth ol many of Earth's greatest legends. Unfortunately, such meet- ings rarely went well for the visitors. Though the fraal tried to join hu- man society from Ihe moment they arrived in Ihe region, they kepi run- ning into problems. Primitive hu- mans displayed great fear when the fraal approached, looking upon the aliens as magical creatures, spirits, or even gods. As humanity ad- vanced, making contact didn't get any easier. Fear turned to distrust and haired, and humanity's violent nature was too much for the peaceful fraal to deal with. Eventually, they withdrew and went into hiding in other parts of the solar system, watching humanity from afar and waiting for the proper moment to re- veal themselves. Attempts made by the fraal in the 20th century resulted in tales of flying saucers and alien abductions, but little else. If they were capable of the emotion, the Iraal would have begun to despair.<br>At some later point in human his- tory, however, a meeting of the minds finally took place. As humanity put aside its own hostile nature to create a world of peace, the ancient visitors revealed themselves. The fraal joined forces with the humans, help- ing to lead humanity to the next great plateau. A free exchange of knowledge and ideas advanced both societies in numerous ways. One of the fraal's most significant gifts spawned a leap in technology that paved the way for true fas ter- than light travel. Both sides prospered, and they soon merged to become a united society.</p>","unidentified":""},"source":"","pubnsource":"","type":"humanoid","availability":"","modifiers":[],"hp":{"value":1,"min":1},"abilityMods":{"parts":[]},"broadSkills":{"acrob":false,"admin":false,"animaha":false,"armorop":false,"athle":false,"aware":true,"busin":false,"compusc":false,"creat":false,"cultu":false,"decep":false,"demol":false,"enter":false,"heavywe":false,"interact":true,"inves":false,"knowl":true,"law":false,"leade":false,"lifesc":false,"manip":false,"medicsc":false,"meleewe":false,"moderra":false,"movem":false,"navig":false,"physisc":false,"primira":false,"resol":true,"secur":false,"stami":false,"steal":false,"streesm":false,"survi":false,"systeop":false,"tacti":false,"teach":false,"technsc":false,"unarmat":false,"vehicop":true},"size":"fine","subtype":"","skills":{"armorop":false,"athle":true,"heavywe":false,"meleewe":false,"unarmat":false,"acrob":false,"manip":false,"moderra":false,"primira":false,"steal":false,"vehicop":true,"movem":false,"stami":true,"survi":false,"busin":false,"compusc":false,"demol":false,"knowl":true,"law":false,"lifesc":false,"medicsc":false,"navig":false,"physisc":false,"secur":false,"systeop":false,"tacti":false,"technsc":false,"admin":false,"animaha":false,"aware":true,"creat":false,"inves":false,"resol":false,"streesm":false,"teach":false,"cultu":false,"decep":false,"enter":false,"interact":true,"leade":false},"broadskillpoints":6,"damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"parts":[]}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.qVNvG3gaBGuQE5g5"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"Alternityd100","systemVersion":"0.3","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1673333771085,"modifiedTime":1684636101875,"lastModifiedBy":"9dIjdsaLSZF7G5jr"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"9dIjdsaLSZF7G5jr":3},"_id":"xrQxYuxCXQZfoSqP"}
